**Epicodus capstone project proposal, 5.29.2020**

### LGBTQ Resource Finder
An app for members of the LGBTQ community to search for social services they may be eligible for.
*****
###### Background: UX Design
_The UX design process has three basic steps: **research, design, and repeat.**_

_Since I'm currently studying UX Design - alongside my course work at Epicodus - I plan to integrate UX design best practices into my capstone project._

### Project Goal
The project's goal is twofold: 
  1. To practice UX  principles and methods
  2. To create an accessible and intuitive mobile-first site that lets users search for services such as food, housing, and childcare.

###### Action Plan
To meet my goal, I will:
1. Research current resource finder apps: specifically 211info.org, and their corresponding mobile app.

2. Design and administer surveys to current users of the 211 app.

3. Determine ways to improve upon the existing search features. 

4. Sketch out several designs on paper and choose one to build out with React.

5. Build a mobile demo app with React and test it again with the original survey respondants.

<!-- ###### Background: LGBTQ Focus

I chose to center the app's focus on the LGBTQ community because: 
  * It's a cause I'm both a part of and passionate about
  * It's clearly distinct from any services that are currently being offered, so that no claims of copyright infringement can be made. 
  * It can still show general social services, such as food, housing, and childcare, so the scope of the search can stay essentially the same.

I chose to focus on a mobile build because:

  * "Mobile first" is an important design principle
  * A mobile app is more accessible to vulnerable populations - not everyone has computer access, but most people have a phone. 
  * I haven't yet created a mobile first build, so it's a good challenge!  -->

### MVP
_List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:_
* A user survey that follows UX best practices
* The compiled results of said survey
* A mobile app that has:
  * Search features
  * Search results
  * The ability to narrow results by demographic parameters once the search is complete.
* Note: as this project is primarily focused on UX research and front-end design, dummy data will be used for the MVP.

###### Tools for MVP:
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* React
* Materialize CSS library: to optimize the app for mobile viewing, and ensure accessibilty

* * *

### Further Exploration

* If I have time, my next step is to integrate an API. The city of New York has an open API that lists 1000+ social services available to women, so I could use that data, or a dummy API.
* I would also do further research on accessibility, to make sure my app is accessible for all. 

###### Tools for Further Exploration
* AXIOS - to query APIs
* Materials on accessibility standards

<!-- _In a perfect world I would:_
* Continue the UX design process of "Research, Design, Repeat."
  * Ask the original survey participants for feedback on my new app.
  * Compile the results and determine what changes need to be made.
  * Integrate those changes into my app.
* Spend more time looking into accessibility standards, and making sure my app meets them.
* Spend time learning tools like FIGMA, so that I could ask users for feedback on new ideas or features. -->

## NYC Social Service Search / Epicodus React Capstone
This project is the culimation of my studies in JavaScript/React front end web development at Epicodus.
It's a mobile-friendly web app designed for residents of New York City to search for social services.

### Description
The Social Services Finder allows people to enter criteria and search for services they may be eligible for. 

While this is a student demo project, the ultimate goal would be to create a site with resources for those in crisis, with up-to-date info on each agency's availability and eligibility requirements.

The data used is courtesy of New York City's open data initiative, and can be viewed [here](https://data.world/city-of-ny/pqg4-dm6b).

### Demo
Use this app online at [wrunion.github.io/epicodus-capstone](https://wrunion.github.io/epicodus-capstone/).

### Background 

I've been involved in the social service industry for years, and I've witnessed the real harm that arises from lack of access to resources.

Many people lack basic necessities, and don't realize they qualify for assistance, because the information isn't freely available. If a database of resources exists at all, it's often in a format that's difficult or impossible for people to access.

Since resourcing and case management is a long-term passion of mine, I wove that into this project and set out to create a Social Service Finder that would be intuitive and easy to use.
